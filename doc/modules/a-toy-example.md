A Toy Example
=============

Here is a toy example to help users get the hand of this library.

- Include the headers
  @snippet Example/image_stitch_and_extraction.cpp include

- This is an example code for converting all the raw FOVs of the Banff chip into the final heatmap.
  @snippet Example/image_stitch_and_extraction.cpp code

Where to next
=============

Now that you have everything installed, and you have already had some basic knowledge on the operation of our program. See the following sections for further information if you needed it.

For information on detecting markers under the bright field, see [Bright-Field Marker Detection](#bright-field-marker-detection).

For information on detecting markers under the fluorescence, see [Fluorescence Marker Detection](#fluorescence-marker-detection).

For information on estimating the rotation angle and calibrating the chip image, see [Image Rotation Angle Estimation and Calibration](#image-rotation-angle-estimation-and-calibration).

For information on gridding the chip image, see [Image Gridding](#image-gridding).

For information on using minCV to define the probe intensity, see [Image Feature Extraction](#image-feature-extraction).

For information on stitching all FOVs into a complete chip image, see [Image Stitching](#image-stitching).
