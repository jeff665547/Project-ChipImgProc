Gridding
========

Here is a brief introduction on image gridding.

Gridding input
--------------

1. A raw chip image (The raw image from SUMMIT). It is loaded by OpenCV in the [fluorescence marker detection](@ref doc/modules/fluorescence-marker-detection.md) section.
2. A marker layout object generated by `chipimgproc::marker::make_single_pattern_reg_mat_layout()` function in the [fluorescence marker detection](@ref doc/modules/fluorescence-marker-detection.md) section.
3. A marker region object having the right marker positions. (The wrong-positioned markers and the missing markers are corrected or infered from `chipimgproc::marker::detection::reg_mat_infer()`)
4. A logger - Log output.

Gridding output
